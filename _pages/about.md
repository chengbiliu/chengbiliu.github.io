Hello, my name is Chengbi Liu and welcome to my personal website. I'm a PhD candidate at the GGS Department at George Mason University. I have been broadly trained in the field of geography including GIS, geovisualization, spatial statistics, and spatial database. 

I have a keen interest in working with (unconventional) social media data to see how they affect our society and environment. Recently, I'm analyzing data from an AR-based social media (Wallame) to find new methods to visualize places around us.

Feel free to download my cv [here](https://chengbiliu.github.io/files/cv.pdf).

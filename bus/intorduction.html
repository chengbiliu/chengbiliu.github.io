<p align="left">Introduction:<br />
  For this project I would like to build an application for the Washington Metropolitan Area Transportation Authority (WMATA) to show the real-time location of buses it operates on a map using the leaflet real-time plugin (<a href="https://github.com/perliedman/leaflet-realtime">https://github.com/perliedman/leaflet-realtime</a>). The Washington Metropolitan Area Transportation Authority serves the metropolitan area of Washington D.C. and offers real-time information of buses and metro in JSON format. However, it does not provide a neat web application which visualizes the real-time movement of vehicles in a map, at least not in a webpage. To compare it with other cities, I did some search on various cities&rsquo; transit authority websites (Chicago, New York, Philadelphia, Seattle, etc.) and noticed that many of them do offer real-time information often including arrival/departure times of bus/train and report of incidents in a map format (e.g., <a href="http://www.transitchicago.com/apps/#web">http://www.transitchicago.com/apps/#web</a>, <a href="http://tripplanner.kingcounty.gov/hiwire?.a=iRealTimeDisplay">http://tripplanner.kingcounty.gov/hiwire?.a=iRealTimeDisplay</a>, etc.). Therefore, users would have to refresh their webpages constantly to receive the most updated bus/train/metro information. My goal with the project is to let users be able to view the location and movement of buses/metro/train in a map and to get the detailed status of a vehicle in a pop-up window accordingly.</p>

<p align="left">Data description:<br />
  WMATA has a nicely developed API for users to get data such as direction and location of the bus. We can also know bus&rsquo; route and whether it is late from deviation. From these data, we can do prospect functionalities such as:<br />
  Map of bus lines and stations in Washington D.C. and details of each line and station.<br />
  Map of real-time bus locations, direction and status (refreshed at a certain frequency)<br />
  Ability to highlight one bus line on the map<br />
  Ability to show user which bus is the next, and some detail of that bus (such as driver information).</p>
